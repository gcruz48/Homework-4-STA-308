This file contains a function birthdayCheck. This function randomly generates a number of birthdays and determines how many matches there are.
The function accepts the parameter num_people which corresponds to the number of people that are together. It has a default value of 23.
It returns a value of how many days have a match.
10 simulations are then run with the function, each with a different number of people (10, 20, 30, ...100). The distributions of these simulations are evaluated with bar graphs and related to the Central Limit Theorem.
